## About this software
The program titled "hrm-client" provides an easy-to-use interface to "heart_rate_databases_introduction". When the program is running, the user simply needs to type the patient's email address into the search bar and click "GET DATA" to receive a list of all the recorded heart rates for that patient, as well as a list of the times at which those heart rates were recorded.
